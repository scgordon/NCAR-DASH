# NCAR-DASH
A resource for the DSET team to explore metadata in the DASH WAF and determine curation needs. 

The Evaluation notebook should allow the user to gain an understanding of metadataEvaluation.py functions used to create data products.

The Demonstration notebook directly addresses the information needs listed below.

* Check the occurrance of metadata elements, clarify the xpaths and create a comparison of the percentage the element occurrs across DASH collections

* Check for a specific set of essential elements accross the collection, provide counts.

* Create lists of records at NCAR that do not contain an element

* Create lists of what content occurs at a specific element and count the unique values to see what variations occurr at selected elements. Useful for identifiying opportunities to ensure consistency. Also useful to see if nonstandard element content has a standardized location
