# NCAR-DASH
A resource for the DSET team to explore metadata in the DASH WAF and determine curation needs. 

The Evaluation notebook should allow the user to gain an understanding of metadataEvaluation.py functions used to create data products.

The Demonstration notebook directly addresses the information needs listed below and shows the location the csv files are for each data product for further visualization in other environments.

* Check the occurrence of metadata elements and compare percentages across DASH collections

* Check for a specific set of essential elements across the collection, provide counts, provide occurrence

* Create lists of records at NCAR that do not contain an element

* Create lists of what content occurs at a selected element 

* count the unique values of content at a selected element to see what variations occurr at selected elements. Useful for identifiying opportunities to ensure consistency. Also useful to see if nonstandard element content has a standardized location
