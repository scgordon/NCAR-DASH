# NCAR-DASH
A resource for the DSET team to explore metadata created to date and determine curation needs. 
This notebook should allow the user to gain an understanding of metadataEvaluation.py

https://github.com/scgordon/MetadataEvaluation/blob/master/notebook/metadataEvaluation.py

Particularly in the context of a single dialect repository that has a specific set of essential elements and wants to determine if the records are complete, and the content accurate.
